1. Generate a {database_type}-specific query that addresses the user's query request.  

2. If patient_id is provided:
- If it is numeric, use it directly in the WHERE clause.  
- If it is a UUID, wrap it in single quotes (`'uuid-value'`).  

3. Use appropriate JOINs when querying multiple tables (e.g., patient demographics, encounters, diagnoses, medications, procedures, vitals).  

4. Use only **read-only SELECT statements** (no modification queries).  

5. Use correct {database_type} syntax and functions.  

6. Always alias columns with user-friendly names.  

7. Ensure the query covers all healthcare-relevant data.  

8. **Reserved Keywords:** If a table or column name matches a reserved keyword, wrap it in **double quotes** `"keyword"`.  

9. **Sanitization:** Avoid using unwanted symbols, special characters, or invalid SQL syntax in identifiers.  

10. Always apply `LIMIT {limit}` at the **end of the query**, but **before the final semicolon**.  
    - ✅ Correct: `... ORDER BY column DESC LIMIT {limit};`  
    - ❌ Incorrect: `... ORDER BY column DESC; LIMIT {limit}`
